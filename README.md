## Hierarchical Clustering

Demonstrates the hierarchical clustering technique, which creates a tree of clusters. Hierarchical clustering is well-suited for understanding hierarchical structures in data.

## K-Means Clustering

Explores the K-Means clustering algorithm, which partitions data into 'K' number of centroids.

## DBSCAN

Covers the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm. It's a density-based clustering method.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Introduces PCA, a method used to reduce the dimensionality of datasets by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables.

## UMAP

UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a dimension reduction technique used to visualize high-dimensional data.

## Agglomerative Clustering

Explores the agglomerative clustering algorithm, a type of hierarchical clustering that builds a hierarchy of clusters by merging together small clusters.

## Apriori Algorithm

Demonstrates the Apriori algorithm, used for mining frequent itemsets and relevant association rules.

## FP-Growth Algorithm

An alternative to the Apriori algorithm, FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) is used for association rule mining.

## t-SNE

t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) is a tool for visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Setup and Usage

To run the Jupyter notebooks:

1. Ensure Jupyter is installed.
2. Navigate to the desired directory.
3. Launch Jupyter and open the desired notebook.
